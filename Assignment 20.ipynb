    "1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Float : \n",
    "It is a floating binary point type variable. Which means it represents a number in itâ€™s binary form. Float is a single precision 32 bits(6-9 significant figures) data type. It is used mostly in graphic libraries because of very high demand for processing power, and also in conditions where rounding errors are not very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decimal : \n",
    "It is a floating decimal point type variable. Which means it represents a number using decimal numbers (0-9). It uses 128 bits(28-29 significant figures) for storing and representing data. Therefore, it has more precision than float. They are mostly used in financial applications because of their high precision and easy to avoid rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.They represent the same value but internally they are stored in different memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What happens if the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') is checked?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. It returns True\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why is it preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Because with string we will get specified no of zeros whereas with a floating point value we get arbitrary nos as shown below.f you need a precise decimal representation of a number, using strings to create your Decimal objects is a very simple way to achieve this.\n",
    "x = decimal.Decimal(\"0.1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x)            # 0.1\n",
    "print(f\"{x:.20f}\")  # 0.10000000000000000000\n",
    "\n",
    "x = decimal.Decimal(0.1)\n",
    "print(x)  # 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In an arithmetic phrase, how simple is it to combine Decimal objects with integers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "import decimal\n",
    "\n",
    "x = decimal.Decimal(34)  # 34\n",
    "We can now use x just like any other number, and we'll get a Decimal object back when performing mathematical operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x + 7)         # 41\n",
    "print(type(x + 7))   # <class 'decimal.Decimal'>\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x // 7)        # 4\n",
    "print(type(x // 7))  # <class 'decimal.Decimal'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Can Decimal objects and floating-point values be combined easily?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.They cant be combined.They give Type Error.\n",
    "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Using the Fraction class but not the Decimal class, give an example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "from fractions import Fraction\n",
    "Fraction(2.5)\n",
    "Output:Fraction(5, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Describe a quantity that can be accurately expressed by the Decimal or Fraction classes but not by a floating-point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.Consider the following two fraction objects: Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(5, 10). Is the internal state of these two objects the same? Why do you think that is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Internally thay are stored in two different memory locations as fraction object is taking different integers as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. How do the Fraction class and the integer type (int) relate to each other? Containment or inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fraction class inherits from the abstract base class numbers. Rational , and implements all of the methods and operations from that class."
