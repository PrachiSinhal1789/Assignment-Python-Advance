    "Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Probability distribution yields the possible outcomes for any random event. Probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment. It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space). \n",
    "For instance, if X is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss (\"the experiment\"), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 (1 in 2 or 1/2) for X = heads, and 0.5 for X = tails (assuming that the coin is fair).\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The difference between true random number generators (TRNGs) and pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) is that TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers (like atmospheric noise), and PRNGs use mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated). Software-generated random numbers only are pseudorandom. They are not truly random because the computer uses an algorithm based on a distribution, and are not secure because they rely on deterministic, predictable algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. Mean and standard deviation.\n",

    "Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Probability distribution yields the possible outcomes for any random event. As the no of trials grow the curve moves closer towards bell curve.\n",

    "Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Using random.shuffle() method in the random module is used to shuffle a list. It takes a sequence, such as a list, and reorganizes the order of the items. This shuffle() method changes the original list, it does not return a new list.\n",
